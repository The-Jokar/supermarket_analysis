This project takes a real supermaket chain data set and analysises how likely a customer is to purchase and item B given they already have item A in their basket

Utilising the Pandas library and Mlxtend library it reads csv file and merges them in the correct format for the apiori algorithm
Then using mlxtend the apiori algorithm is used to calculate the support, lift, and frequency.
In the jupyter notebook I think take some of the data and provide suggestions to the supermaket as to what they can do to take advantage of these patterns and \
improve profits by maximising the number of people how purchas item A to purchase item B and C as well
